     * The 103 (Early Hints) informational status code indicates to the
     * client that the server is likely to send a final response with the
     * header fields included in the informational response.
     *
     * Typically, a server will include the header fields sent in a 103
     * (Early Hints) response in the final response as well.  However, there
     * might be cases when this is not desirable, such as when the server
     * learns that the header fields in the 103 (Early Hints) response are
     * not correct before the final response is sent.
     *
     * A client can speculatively evaluate the header fields included in a
     * 103 (Early Hints) response while waiting for the final response.  For
     * example, a client might recognize a Link header field value
     * containing the relation type "preload" and start fetching the target
     * resource.  However, these header fields only provide hints to the
     * client; they do not replace the header fields on the final response.
     *
     * Aside from performance optimizations, such evaluation of the 103
     * (Early Hints) response's header fields MUST NOT affect how the final
     * response is processed.  A client MUST NOT interpret the 103 (Early
     * Hints) response header fields as if they applied to the informational
     * response itself (e.g., as metadata about the 103 (Early Hints)
     * response).
     *
     * A server MAY use a 103 (Early Hints) response to indicate only some
     * of the header fields that are expected to be found in the final
     * response.  A client SHOULD NOT interpret the nonexistence of a header
     * field in a 103 (Early Hints) response as a speculation that the
     * header field is unlikely to be part of the final response.
     *
     * The following example illustrates a typical message exchange that
     * involves a 103 (Early Hints) response.
     *
     * Client request:
     * ```
     *  GET / HTTP/1.1
     *  Host: example.com
     * ```
     *
     * Server response:
     * ```
     *  HTTP/1.1 103 Early Hints
     *  Link: </style.css>; rel=preload; as=style
     *  Link: </script.js>; rel=preload; as=script
     *
     *  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
     *  Date: Fri, 26 May 2017 10:02:11 GMT
     *  Content-Length: 1234
     *  Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
     *  Link: </style.css>; rel=preload; as=style
     *  Link: </script.js>; rel=preload; as=script
     *
     *  <!doctype html>
     *  [... rest of the response body is omitted from the example ...]
     * ```
     *
     * As is the case with any informational response, a server might emit
     * more than one 103 (Early Hints) response prior to sending a final
     * response.  This can happen, for example, when a caching intermediary
     * generates a 103 (Early Hints) response based on the header fields of
     * a stale-cached response, and then forwards a 103 (Early Hints)
     * response and a final response that were sent from the origin server
     * in response to a revalidation request.
     *
     * A server MAY emit multiple 103 (Early Hints) responses with
     * additional header fields as new information becomes available while
     * the request is being processed.  It does not need to repeat the
     * fields that were already emitted, though it doesn't have to exclude
     * them either.  The client can consider any combination of header
     * fields received in multiple 103 (Early Hints) responses when
     * anticipating the list of header fields expected in the final
     * response.
     *
     * The following example illustrates a series of responses that a server
     * might emit.  In the example, the server uses two 103 (Early Hints)
     * responses to notify the client that it is likely to send three Link
     * header fields in the final response.  Two of the three expected
     * header fields are found in the final response.  The other header
     * field is replaced by another Link header field that contains a
     * different value.

     *
     * ... 26012 bytes of partial image data ...
     * If multiple parts are being transferred, the server generating the 206

     * avoid confusion with single-part responses, a server must not generate a
     * Content-Range header field in the HTTP header section of a multiple part
     * response (this field will be sent in each part instead).
     * Within the header area of each body part in the multipart payload, the
     * server must generate a Content-Range header field corresponding to the
     * range being enclosed in that body part. If the selected representation
     * would have had a Content-Type header field in a 200 (OK) response, the
     * server should generate that same Content-Type field in the header area of

     *  Date: Wed, 15 Nov 1995 06:25:24 GMT

     * ```
     *
     * When multiple ranges are requested, a server may coalesce any of the
     * ranges that overlap, or that are separated by a gap that is smaller than
     * the overhead of sending multiple parts, regardless of the order in which
     * the corresponding byte-range-spec appeared in the received Range header
     * field. Since the typical overhead between parts of a multipart/byteranges
     * payload is around 80 bytes, depending on the selected representation's
     * media type and the chosen boundary parameter length, it can be less
     * efficient to transfer many small disjoint parts than it is to transfer
     * the entire selected representation.
     *
     * A server must not generate a multipart response to a request for a single
     * range, since a client that does not request multiple parts might not
     * support multipart responses. However, a server may generate a
     * multipart/byteranges payload with only a single body part if multiple
     * ranges were requested and only one range was found to be satisfiable or
     * only one range remained after coalescing. A client that cannot process a
     * multipart/byteranges response must not generate a request that asks for
     * multiple ranges.
     *
     * When a multipart response payload is generated, the server should send
     * the parts in the same order that the corresponding byte-range-spec
     * appeared in the received Range header field, excluding those ranges that
     * were deemed unsatisfiable or that were coalesced into other ranges. A
     * client that receives a multipart response must inspect the Content-Range
     * header field present in each body part in order to determine which range
     * is contained in that body part; a client cannot rely on receiving the
     * same ranges that it requested, nor the same order that it requested.
     *
     * When a 206 response is generated, the server must generate the following
     * header fields, in addition to those required above, if the field would
     * have been sent in a 200 (OK) response to the same request: Date,
     * Cache-Control, ETag, Expires, Content-Location, and Vary.
     *
     * If a 206 is generated in response to a request with an If-Range header
     * field, the sender should not generate other representation header fields
     * beyond those required above, because the client is understood to already
     * have a prior response containing those header fields. Otherwise, the
