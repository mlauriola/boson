# Branding & Layout

## Overview

The Branding & Layout page allows administrators to customize the visual appearance of the application. Changes made here apply system-wide, allowing you to align the back office interface with your organization's brand identity.

## Purpose

This page enables administrators to:

- Customize the application color scheme
- Upload a custom logo
- Set the application name
- Preview changes in real-time before saving

## Key Features

### Colors Configuration

You can customize the following interface elements:

- **Brand Color**: Used for primary text and headers.
- **Primary Button**: Background color for main actions (e.g., "Save", "Create").
- **Secondary Button**: Background color for secondary actions (e.g., "Cancel", "Back").
- **Danger Button**: Background color for destructive actions (e.g., "Delete").
- **Table Header**: Background color for data table headers.

**How to change a color:**
1. Click the color square next to the element name.
2. Use the color picker to select your desired color.
3. The "Live Preview" section will immediately update to show the change.

### Logo Configuration

**Upload Logo:**
- Click "Choose File" to select a new image file.
- Supported formats: PNG, JPG, SVG.
- The logo will be resized automatically to fit the header.
- **Note:** The logo file is saved as `ClientLogo.png`.

**Application Name:**
- Enter the text you want to appear in the header next to the logo (e.g., "Microplus BOS").

### Live Preview

The **Live Preview** section demonstrates exactly how your chosen colors will look in the actual application. It includes dummy examples of:
- Header with Logo and Title
- Primary, Secondary, and Danger buttons
- A sample data table

Use this to ensure your color choices provide good contrast and readability before applying them.

### Actions

- **Reset to Defaults**: Reverts all colors to the original system default. Useful if you want to start over.
- **Save Configuration**: Applies your changes to the live system. All users will see the new branding immediately upon their next page reload.

## Best Practices

- **Contrast**: Ensure your text colors contrast well with your background colors for accessibility.
- **Consistency**: Choose a palette that matches your official brand guidelines.
- **Testing**: Use the Live Preview to spot any clashing colors before saving.

## Troubleshooting

### Logo Not Updating
If the logo doesn't change after uploading:
- Try refreshing the page (Ctrl+F5) to clear the browser cache.
- Ensure the image file is not corrupted and is a standard image format.

### Colors Not Saving
- Ensure you click "Save Configuration" after making selections.
- If changes revert after a refresh, check your network connection or contact a system administrator.
